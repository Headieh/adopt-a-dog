# Adopt-A-Dog

This site was the milestone project for the 2rd class (JavaScript & Responsive Design)
of the Front-End certificate program from the University of Washington.
The purpose of this project was to utilize skills learned in this class, using a
mockup for basic design. This site should helps users browse dogs that are
available for adoption and make adopting easier for the user. It also features
a blog with useful information for owners. It provides information about the
dog prior to adoption so prospective owners can learn more about them before
deciding to adopt. After the project was completed and submitted, I went back and
added additional features.

This project demonstrates:
- Vanilla JavaScript/JQuery, HTML5, and CSS fundamentals
- Ability to make dynamic sites interactive
- Best practices and core concepts of responsive design
  (mobile-first design, fluid layouts, and media queries.)
- Web Form Features
- Principles of effective user experience
- Media playback with media elements
- Accessibility Features
- Custom styling, including web fonts
